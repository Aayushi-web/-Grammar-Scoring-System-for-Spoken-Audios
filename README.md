# ðŸŽ§ Grammar Scoring System for Spoken Audios

This project transcribes spoken audio files into text, checks the grammar of the transcribed text, and generates a grammar score using Natural Language Processing (NLP) tools.

## ðŸš€ Features

- âœ… Upload and transcribe audio using Google Speech Recognition
- âœ… Grammar checking using `language_tool_python`
- âœ… Grammar score based on detected issues per word
- âœ… Display of grammar issues with suggestions
- âœ… Corrected version of the transcript

## ðŸ§° Tech Stack

- Python
- Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook
- SpeechRecognition (`speech_recognition`)
- LanguageTool (`language_tool_python`)
- PyAudio (for microphone input if needed)

## ðŸ“¦ Installation

Install dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install SpeechRecognition
pip install PyAudio
pip install language-tool-python
```

## ðŸ“‚ How to Use

## ðŸ“Š Sample Output

* Transcribed text: He go to school everyday and eat a apple.
* Grammar Score: 60.00/100
* Corrected Text: He goes to school every day and eats an apple.

## ðŸ“Œ Future Improvements
. Integrate Whisper for more accurate speech-to-text

. Use GPT-based scoring and correction

. Create a Streamlit or Flask UI

. Sentence-level scoring and visual error highlights

. Handle multiple languages
